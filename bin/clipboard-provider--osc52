# Clipboard provider using OSC 52 (needs terminal support).

# OSC 52 is a special escape sequence that can be used to manipulate
# selections data (the clipboard) by talking to the terminal emulator directly.
#
# Check the xterm spec: https://www.xfree86.org/current/ctlseqs.html
# Search 'Manipulate Selection Data' & 'clipboard'.
#
# The format is: \e]52 ; WHICH-SEL ; CONTENT-AS-BASE64 END
#   \e]52;      -- tells the terminal we want to set a selection/clipboard.
#   WHICH-SEL   -- (single char) tells the terminal which selection we want:
#                  c      : means the clipboard selection
#                  p or s : means the primary or secondary selection (used on Linux X11)
#   CONTENT-AS-BASE64  -- The content to copy, encoded with base64
#   END         -- tells the terminal to end the OSC 52 sequence.
#               -- It should be ST (String Terminator), for xterm it is 'ESC\'
#               -- (note: some terminal also allow the BEL ('\a') to end the sequence)
#
# To test that OSC 52 is supported by your terminal, run this in your shell:
# printf "\033]52;c;Y29weXBhc3RhIQ==\e\\\n"
# The string 'copypasta!' should appear in your system clipboard (set from your terminal).
#
# Initial inspiration from: https://seankhliao.com/blog/12020-05-14-osc-52/
#
# NOTE: if inside tmux, apply 'tmux set-option -g set-clipboard off'
# to ensure the escape sequence is forwarded to the actual terminal.

# --- Find the TTY to send the osc52 sequence to:

# > When through ssh, the most reliable tty is `$SSH_TTY`
# (from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tmux-in-practice-integration-with-system-clipboard-bcd72c62ff7b/)
: ${CLIPBOARD_REQUESTOR_TTY:=${SSH_TTY:-}}


# > When not through ssh, fallback to finding the current tty.
# Neovim requires to go through the /proc/ magic, see https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8450#issuecomment-407063983.
# The main cli-clipboard-provider script sets CLIPBOARD_REQUESTOR_PID,
# use it or fallback to PPID if called directly.
: ${CLIPBOARD_REQUESTOR_PID:=$PPID}
: ${CLIPBOARD_REQUESTOR_TTY:=`(tty || readlink /proc/$CLIPBOARD_REQUESTOR_PID/fd/0) 2>/dev/null | grep /dev/`}
