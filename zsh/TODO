TODO Extract parts of config to separated plugins:
- prompt setup
- fuzzy zle widgets (make configurable provider? Later...)
- (?) cdr' hook modification (=> NO.. just extract it somewhere in my config..)

TODO Better `todo` shell helper, that can not only seach in project files, but also:
- list all `TODO_*` & `FIXME_*` files in a repo (like `repo/TODO_do_this_very_thing`)
- seach in `TODO` & `TODO.md` files
(may need to define a simple TODO file format, with `TODO summary \n rest \n of \n explanation`
and each line starting with TODO/FIXME would start a new todo item, or use some continuation
'blank lines' like `|` to link a paragraph to another)
