## Concepts

TL;DR:
- **Kit**: a module system for a specific use-case
- **Module**: a low-level building block for a _kit_, with options decl/impl on a topic
- **Preset**: use _modules_ and set options with preset values on a specific topic
- **Profile**: a larger _preset_, focused on whole use-case
- **Config**: an evaluation of a full module system config

> [!NOTE]
> Technically _modules_, _presets_ & _profiles_ are all **Modules** in the Nix module system terminology.
> But we make these distinctions to semantically separate declaration vs various uses.


### Kit

A **Kit** is a module system for a specific use-case.

IDEA: Has a `lib.evalWith` function to evaluate the current _kit_ with a set of
_modules_/_presets_/options ðŸ¤”

Example:
- the NixOS module system
- the NixVim module system
- my Zsh config module system, which uses my _tool-kit_ module system


### Module

A **Module** is the low-level building block for a _kit_.
It contains options declaration/implementation on a specific topic.

Examples:
- A NixOS module for `nginx` or `postgresql`.
- A Zsh module for defining _aliases_ or setting _keybinds_.


### Preset

A **Preset** is a composable set of options for a specific **Kit**.

They are partial configurations, focusing on a specific feature.
They may expose a few specific options for their implementation of that feature.

% Example:
Optional modules that can be imported in an OS configuration to add packages / enable some features
from the builtin modules / ..


### Profile

A **Profile** is a big **Preset**, some profiles may be used directly (without tweaks) to build a
full **Config**.

They define  can combine smaller presets or define a bunch of them that
don't really make sense to separate.

they may be combined with

- It references the kit and combines presets (and/or custom values) into a full setup.
- Profiles are user- or environment-specific.
- Each profile is a single, ready-to-use configuration instance.

Example: `workstation-profile.nix` combines several presets for a developer workstation.


### Configs

A **Config** is the evaluation of a **Kit** with all its **Modules**, **Presets**, and **Profiles** applied. It represents the final, concrete configuration ready for use.

Unlike a **Profile**, which is a reusable and composable definition, a **Config** is fully concrete, tailored to a specific environment, user or system.

Examples:
- A NixOS system configuration generated by combining a workstation profile with custom options.
- A Neovim configuration built from a set of presets for plugins and editor settings.
- A Zsh shell configuration derived from a profile for a developer environment.
