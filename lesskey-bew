# Configuration file for keys for the `less` program.
# It must be compiled with `lesskey -o ./some-output.bin -- ./this-file`
# And used like `less --lesskey ./some-output.bin ...`
# See `man lesskey` for more details.

# NOTE on how to use `noaction` to give argument to command.
# For example: There is no command that scrolls one character left or right.
# In less program, typing 1 then a key that does {left,right}-scroll would scroll by 1.
# But we can't directly set a binding for a command with an argument in lesskey file.
# To bypass this, we can set a binding to run a no-op command, then parse more keys.
# So run the `noaction` command, then parse a key sequence that runs the scroll
# command with the desired arguments.
