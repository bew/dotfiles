# Configuration file for keys for the `less` program.
# It must be compiled with `lesskey -o ./some-output.bin -- ./this-file`
# And used like `less --lesskey ./some-output.bin ...`
# See `man lesskey` for more details.

# NOTE on how to use `noaction` to give argument to command.
# For example: There is no command that scrolls one character left or right.
# In less program, typing 1 then a key that does {left,right}-scroll would scroll by 1.
# But we can't directly set a binding for a command with an argument in lesskey file.
# To bypass this, we can set a binding to run a no-op command, then parse more keys.
# So run the `noaction` command, then parse a key sequence that runs the scroll
# command with the desired arguments.

#
# NOTE: A number then an action (like scroll-left) changes the action-count for the rest of the program execution.
# So to have a key that moves by 1 and a key that moves by 40, I need to change the action-count each time.

# --- Define new command keys under the following line:
#command

# Use HJKL to move around by half-a-page
J forw-screen
K back-screen
H noaction 40\e(
L noaction 40\e)

# Use hjkl to move around 1-by-1
j forw-line
k back-line
# See note on how to use `noaction` like this at the top
h noaction 1\e(
l noaction 1\e)

# Disable search highlight
ยง undo-hilite

# Restore help binding
\eh help
:h  help


# --- Defines new line-editing keys under the following line:
#line-edit

# Escape to abort line editing
# \e abort
# FIXME: Does not work, and breaks the hlHL bindings above for some reason
